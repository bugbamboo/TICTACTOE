# TICTACTOE
This is a project that has terminated with a Discord Bot running on a gcloud server that plays tic tac toe for the Exeter Class of 24 Discord server. I used the JDA API to create this, and it is running on a single Google Cloud Compute Engine n1-standard-1 (1 vCPU, 3.75 GB memory) instance.
